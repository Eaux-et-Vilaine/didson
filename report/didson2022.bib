  abstract = {EDA 2.x (Eel Density Analysis) is a modelling tool which allows the prediction of yellow eel densities and silver eel escapement. The model is based on a geo-localized river network database the CCM (Catchment Characterisation and Modelling) (Vogt et al., 2007, 2008) for Europe in the POSE project and the RHT (Réseau Hydrographique Théorique) (Pella et al., in press) for France. The model is applied on 5 Eel Management Unit (EMU) located in several European countries and in France on 10 EMU. The principle of the model is (1) to relate observed yellow eel densities to different parameters: sampling methods, environmental conditions (distance from the sea, relative distance, temperature, elevation…), anthropogenic conditions (obstacles, land use,...) and time (year trends), (2) to extrapolate the yellow eel densities in each reach of river network by applying the statistical model calibrated in step 1, (3) to calculate the overall yellow eel stock abundance by multiplying these densities by the water surface of the reaches and by summing them (4) to calculate a potential silver eel escapement by converting the yellow eel stock estimated in step 3 into silver eel stock (5) to assess the silver eel escapement by substracting silver eel mortalities (turbines, fisheries) known or estimated (6) to give an estimate of the pristine escapement by running the EDA model with anthropogenic conditions artificially set to zero and time variable sets before 1980. / EDA 2.x (Eel Density Analysis) est un outil de modélisation qui permet de prédire les densités d’anguilles jaunes et l’échappement d’anguilles argentées. Il est basé, dans le cadre du projet POSE, sur le réseau hydrographique géoréférencé européen CCM v2.1 (Catchment Characterisation and Modelling) (Vogt et al., 2007, 2008) et, au niveau national, sur le Réseau Hydrographique Théorique (RHT, Pella et al., in press) afin de tester ce modèle, respectivement sur 5 Unités de Gestion Anguille (UGA) Européens et sur 10 UGA françaises. Le principe de cette approche est (1) de relier les densités d’anguilles jaunes observées lors de pêches électriques à différents paramètres : méthodes d’échantillonnage, conditions environnementales (distance à la mer, distance relative, température, altitude, …), conditions anthropiques (obstacles, occupation du sol, …) et temps, (2) d’extrapoler les densités d’anguilles jaunes dans chaque tronçon du réseau hydrographique en appliquant un modèle statistique calibré à l’étape 1, (3) de calculer l’abondance totale du stock d’anguilles jaunes en multipliant ces densités par la surface en eau des tronçons et en les additionnant (4) de calculer un échappement potentiel en convertissant le stock estimé d’anguilles jaunes à l’étape 3 en stock d’anguilles argentées (5) de calculer un échappement effectif en soustrayant les mortalités d’anguilles argentées (pêcheries, turbines) connues ou estimées, (6) de donner une estimation de l’échappement pristine en considérant les conditions anthropogéniques mises artificiellement à zéro et un jeu temporel de variables avant 1980.},

  institution = {{IMARES}},
  abstract = {To reduce mortality of migrating eel in the pumping station of IJmuiden on the North Sea Canal, Rijkswaterstaat  Noord-Holland has set out a multi-annual and multi-disciplinary research to enable measurements to be taken  and to test for effectiveness.    In the autumn of 2010, at the trash rack of one pump on the inside of the pumping station a fish exclusion system  with strobe lights provided by Fish Flow Innovations was installed. In this report the principle investigator  reported that IMARES carried out the monitoring in the autumn of 2010 with high resolution sonar DIDSON. This  technique allows the behaviour of eel in the proximity of the trash rack with fish exclusion system to be visible  and measurable. The objective of this research is to determine whether the fish exclusion system is effective in  deterring eels that are approaching the pumping station.    In addition, DIDSON recordings were made at the entrance of a gravity outfall next to the pumping station to  determine the behaviour and distribution of migrating eels over the depth of the lock.     Measurements at the pumping station were taken over 11 nights with the DIDSON at the trash rack fitted with the  fish exclusion system, in combination with net catches on the seaward side of the pumping station. The net  catches fall outside the scope of this report. In total, 212 eels were observed with the DIDSON. On three evenings  DIDSON observations were taken with alternate half-hour lights on half hour lights off. These experiments showed  that significantly more eels (at least a factor 10) approached the trash rack when the lights were off in comparison  to when the lights were on. Differences in behaviour were also found.  Within the DIDSON field of vision the percentage of eels that passed through the trash rack varied very little  whether the lights were on or off (18\%), there was less percentage return behaviour when lights were off  compared to on (21\% against 32\%), more swimming behaviour alongside the screen (52\% against 35\%) and fewer  eels that returned out of the trash rack against the current (9 against 15\%).    Measurements were taken over a total of four evenings with the DIDSON at the entrance of a gravity outfall In  total 34 eels swam in the gravity outfall, whereby a larger number swam in the middle of the 6 meter gravity  outfall rather than at the bottom or at the top. A factor of 1.7 more eels swam over the entire 6m depth  compared with the depth class of 0-1 m from the bottom. These differences were not significant.    It can be concluded that the installed fish exclusion system using strobe lights had a clear and significant deterrent  effect on eel and that the behavioural response mainly occurred at a distance outside the field of vision of the  DIDSON beam (several meters distance). In totality it appears a lower proportion of eels pass the trash rack with  lights on.  The study of 2010 (and previous research in 2009) with the lights off displays that a proportion of the eel               show a series of behavioural responses: first, changes in swimming pattern, from swimming forwards to rolling or  drifting in the current with the tail forward followed by turning behaviour which becomes swimming against the  current.  These behavioural responses can be seen as responses to subsequent stimuli related to the pumping station: a  increasingly loud unnatural sound, visual stimuli in the trash rack and from the pumping station and physical  contact with the trash rack. The strobe lights are clearly adding an extra incentive to increase a behavioural  response at distances greater than a few meters from the trash rack (probably resulting in more than a factor of  10 less approach attempts by eels to the trash rack).  Hereby the case is that a smaller proportion of eels will end up in the pumping station with strobe lights.},

Acoustic shadows of templates (20, 30, 40 and 50~cm) and live fish of four species [bream, Abramis brama (L.); barbel, Barbus barbus (L.); chub, Leuciscus cephalus (L.); and trout, Salmo trutta (L.)] were projected on a plate in an experimental set-up and tested on suitability for species discrimination. Twenty-centimetre templates were correctly classified in 97.5\% of the cases, indicating a size threshold. The larger templates reached values of 100\% correct classification based on cross-validated discriminant function analysis. It was also possible to classify moving fish based on screenshots of their acoustic shadows with a certainty of 83.9\%. Extended field tests are required to evaluate the method for use in practical monitoring applications in multispecies river environments.},

  abstract = {A diversified energy portfolio may include marine energy in the form of current energy converters (CECs) such as tidal or in-river turbines. New technology development in the research stage typically requires monitoring for environmental effects. A significant environmental effect of concern for CECs is the risk of moving parts (e.g., turbine blades) colliding with animals such as fishes. CECs are installed in energetic locations in which it is difficult to operate sensors to fulfill monitoring requirements for informing collision risk. Collecting data (i.e., about blade strikes or near-misses) that inform interactions of fishes with CECs is usually attempted using active acoustic sensors or video cameras (VCs). Limitations of low-light conditions or water turbidity that preclude effective use of VCs are overcome by using high-resolution multibeam echosounders (or acoustic cameras (ACs)). We used an AC at two sites to test its ability to detect artificial and real fish targets and determine if strike, near-miss, and near-field behavior could be observed. Interactions with fish and artificial targets with turbines have been documented but strike confirmation with an AC is novel. The first site was in a tidal estuary with a 25 kW turbine and water clarity sufficient to allow VC data to be collected concurrently with AC data showing turbine blade strike on tethered artificial fish targets. The second site was a turbid, debris-laden river with a 5 kW turbine where only AC data were collected due to high water turbidity. Data collection at the second site coincided with downstream Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) smolt migration. Physical fish capture downstream of the turbine was performed with an incline plane trap (IPT) to provide context for the AC observations, by comparing fish catches. Discrimination between debris and fishes in the AC data was not possible, because active movement of fishes was not discernable. Nineteen fishes were released upstream of the turbine to provide known times of possible fish/turbine interactions, but detection was difficult to confirm in the AC data. ACs have been used extensively in past studies to count large migratory fish such as Pacific salmon, but their application for small fish targets has been limited. The results from these two field campaigns demonstrate the ability of ACs to detect targets in turbid water and observe blade strikes, as well as their limitations such as the difficulty of distinguishing small fishes from debris in a high-energy turbid river. Recommendations are presented for future applications associated with CEC device testing.},
